# Image-Captioning
 Image captioning generates textual descriptions for images using deep learning. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract image features and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or Transformers to create captions, enabling machines to understand and describe visual content accurately.
